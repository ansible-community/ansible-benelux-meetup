Vagrant
A good practice in modern development is to create an environment locally, that mimics the production environment as close as possible. If you run Windows or OSX that means running VirtualBox or VMWare as a 'host' and Linux as a 'guest'. Production environments often are virtualized, and/or, containerized.  Hashicorp released an excellent tool to manipulate VM's using the command line: Vagrant.


# TODO 1. Download and install Vagrant from: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

 TODO 2. cd to the 'project' directory using the command shell/Terminal
# TYPE:   vagrant up

This will start the virtual machines used in this workshop on your laptop.

# TALK: Offer help to members in your group, you all need a good setup.

# TIP: The project folder "transponds" to the Linux machine.
